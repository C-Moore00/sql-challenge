# sql-challenge
Hello again! Long time no submit.

I'm quite late on these. I am quite literally praying that I get them all in for the Thursday deadline, as my procrastination has inevitably caught up with me.

Let's see how many we can get through!

## YOU MUST IMPORT DATA INTO PGADMIN VIA ITS "Import/Export..." FUNCTION, THERE IS NO LINE DOING IT
I made the ERD of Employees DB through QuickDBD, and exported that file, its original information is available in "Schema Logical".
The SQL to create the DB and Tables are in one fell swoop in "Create DB.sql".
All queries are contained within "Queries.sql"

Apparently I've still the quick capacity for SQL from another course ages ago. Wonders what using skills does to retaining them!

All other things not mentioned are my own work.

Note that there is ambiguity within the dataset - without further instruction, though it is not the case with this data, it is, in theory, possible that a given employee could manage multiple departments, thus cardinality is many-to-many.
